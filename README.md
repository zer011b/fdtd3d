# fdtd3d

This is an open-source implementation of FDTD Maxwell's equations solver for different dimensions (1, 2 or 3) with support of concurrency (MPI/OpenMP/Cuda) if required. The key idea is building of solver for your specific needs with different components, i.e. concurrency support with enabled MPI, OpenMP or GPU support, parallel buffer types, specific dimension and others.

For additional info on current project development status and future plans check issues and milestones.

# Build Process

Build is done using cmake. Also there are build and run scripts you could find useful.

## Release Build

```sh
mkdir Release
cd Release
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

## Debug Build

```sh
mkdir Debug
cd Debug
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make
```

## Additional Example

Build command for 3D grid:

```sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVALUE_TYPE=d -DCOMPLEX_FIELD_VALUES=ON -DTIME_STEPS=2 -DPARALLEL_GRID_DIMENSION=3 -DPRINT_MESSAGE=OFF -DPARALLEL_GRID=ON -DPARALLEL_BUFFER_DIMENSION=xyz -DCXX11_ENABLED=ON -DCUDA_ENABLED=OFF -DCUDA_ARCH_SM_TYPE=sm_50
```

# Testing

To start unit tests do next

```sh
./Tools/build-and-run-unit-tests.sh <home_dir_of_the_project>
```

# Build Flags

Solver incorporates following features which could be set up during build.

```c_cpp
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - build type (Debug or Release)
VALUE_TYPE - use float (f), double (d) or long double (ld) floating point values
COMPLEX_FIELD_VALUES - use complex values or not (ON of OFF)
TIME_STEPS - number of steps in time (1 or 2)
PARALLEL_GRID_DIMENSION - number of dimensions in parallel grid (1, 2 or 3)
PRINT_MESSAGE - print debug output (ON or OFF)
PARALLEL_GRID - use parallel grid or not (ON or OFF)
PARALLEL_BUFFER_DIMENSION - dimension of parallel buffers, i.e. actual coordinate systems (x, y, z, xy, yz, xz, xyz)
CXX11_ENABLED - allow support of C++11 (ON or OFF)
CUDA_ENABLED - enable support of GPU (ON or OFF)
CUDA_ARCH_SM_TYPE - sm type for GPU
```

If any of the flags change or some new are added, testing scripts should be updated.

# Launch

Example of launch command for 2D build

```sh
cd Release/Source
./fdtd3d 100 100 100 1 1
```

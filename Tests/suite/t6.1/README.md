# Description

This is test with plane wave in vacuum in 3D mode. With TF/SF enabled the result is the same wave amplitude at all
points in total field area.

Tests launched: `Example/vacuum3D.txt`, `Example/vacuum3D_scattered.txt`

# Result vacuum3D

Amplitude mode. Red is the 1.0 amplitude in total field area, blue is 0.0 amplitude in scattered field area.

# Result vacuum3D_scattered

Amplitude mode. Blue is 0.0 amplitude in all points, as only scattered field is saved.
